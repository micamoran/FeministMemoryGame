      <h3> Intersectional Feminism: </h3>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Intersectionality considers all the ways in which power systems and
        inequalities are based on race, ethnicity, class, gender, gender
        identity, disability, and sexual orientation, and describes how these
        are part of discrimination and oppression of people. Intersectionality
        should be taken into account when discussing feminism because it
        includes all backgrounds and marginalized communities, understanding
        that we all have different experiences. In “Sisterhood: Political
        Solidarity Between Women” hooks explains that these concepts shouldn’t
        be separated and have to be taken as a part of the same concern (hooks,
        20). This means that feminism doesn’t need certain groups of women
        caring for specific subjects (for example, not only black women should
        fight racism, or not only poor women should dispute classism and social
        structures). As a matter of fact, we need to understand that we have our
        differences and fight together against the same concern. “Feminism as a
        collective movement is made out of how we are moved to become feminists
        in dialogue with others”, explains Ahmed in “Living a Feminist Life”.

      <h3> Gender Identity: </h3>
      <p>
        {" "}
        How a person identifies and defines themself. It is different from sex,
        which refers to genitalia and is defined by the body, and different from
        gender expression, which is how we choose to show ourselves to the
        world. Gender is culturally and socially developed. Gender is often
        policed and scrutinized when a person is “hard to read”, “too feminine”,
        or “too masculine”. I would like to quote a suggestion from Dean Spades
        on how to interact in an inclusive way with the trans and intersex
        community. Spades suggest different ways to talk about bodies and
        genitalia that are not referring to a specific gender. For example,
        talking about menstruation or pregnancy, the correct use of inclusive
        language would be “people who menstruate” or “people who are pregnant”
        (“About Purportedly Gendered Body Parts”).{" "}
      </p>
      <h3> Women’s Representation in Media: </h3>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Women are usually represented in media as stereotypically hegemonic,
        heterosexual, skinny, often white, fragile, weak, etc. They are usually
        represented as objects of men’s desires, and their chores are often
        related to caring for the family and staying at home. If a woman does
        not fit these specifications, then she's portrayed as too rebellious,
        too promiscuous, etc. Heteronormative gender roles only contribute to
        the false stereotype that we all have to do what our gender dictates.
        This does not exist, it is not real, and it also perpetuates the idea
        that women are objects and only serve for the entertainment of men, or
        that men are the bosses of the house, and that they can unquestionably
        pursue women regardless of their own desire. Robin Tran writes in “4
        Ways Men Are Taught to Objectify Women From Birth” about how men have
        internalized ways of thinking and objectifying women throughout their
        lives, all thought through media. The four things that Robin highlights
        are, first, that the media creates and perpetuates the idea that women
        should be persecuted by men and that their opinions and ideas don't
        count. He said: “In essence, women operated as empty vessels for men to
        project their wants and needs onto” (Tran). Second, the perpetuation of
        gender roles in school (beliefs like boys should not cry like girls).
        The third is the damage of cis-normative language and the way of
        assuming that all people are cisgender and heterosexual. And the last
        one is that men are constantly instructed to think that women are their
        property. All of this contributes to stereotyping and objectifying
        women.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3> Disability Justice: </h3>
      <p>
        {" "}
        A movement that centers “disabled people of color, immigrants with
        disabilities, queers with disabilities, trans and gender non-conforming
        people with disabilities, people with disabilities who are houseless,
        people with disabilities who are incarcerated, people with disabilities
        who have had their ancestral lands stolen, amongst others” (“Sick of
        it!”). It is relatively a recent movement that was launched by three
        disabled women of color. The disabled community maintains that their
        bodies are not which makes them incapable, is the society that causes
        the community to be oppressed. The concept of ableism is sustained as a
        discriminatory control system, which is exercised to isolate disabled
        people instead of uniting and incorporating them into society. Only the
        individuals who serve the capitalist system are the chosen ones, the
        rest are discarded.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3> Reproductive Justice: </h3>
      <p>
        {" "}
        SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Health Collective, the biggest
        national, multicultural, and multiracial movement for Reproductive
        Justice, understands Reproductive Justice as “the human right to
        maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and
        parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities”
        (“Reproductive Justice”). This means, having access to make personal
        decisions about our bodies, though this doesn’t end in an individual
        right but involves the whole community, including access to
        comprehensive sex education, information, prevention and care related to
        STIs, access to contraceptives and birth control, access to safe
        abortion, prenatal and pregnancy care, respect of the rights to have
        children, access to clean water and safe houses, and furthermore,
        protection and assistance for gender violence or domestic violence. In
        all these instances, starting from the choice to not have children to
        the choice of being parents, RJ is intrinsic to the free decisions of
        the gestating bodies. Moreover, it's not just about choices, explains
        SisterSong, it's mainly about access.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3> Sexual Harassment and Gender Violence: </h3>
      <p>
        {" "}
        There are two different forms of misogyny and abuse or violence toward
        women, these are public and private. The private can be considered as
        gender violence and is the one exercised by men with their girlfriends
        or wives, they perceive that their masculinity is threatened and that
        they must establish their dominance over women who are “out of their
        control” (Arruzza et. al, 27). The other form of exercising misogyny can
        be determined as public violence or sexual harassment, and it is
        exercised by bosses in the workplace, in clinics by doctors, in the
        streets by the police, by different people who are in power, and by
        teachers in the classroom. This type of violence is perpetuated as an
        instrument of exercising power over women, it is also institutional
        violence, and the economy, race, and professionalism of women are at
        stake.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3> Family: </h3>
      <p>
        {" "}
        It is often associated with women, motherhood, and family, but this
        stereotypical heterosexist concept about the binary of the genders and
        the imposed gender roles is not accurate. Not every woman desires to be
        a mother. In “Moral Dilemmas, Moral Strategies and the Transformation of
        Gender”, Kathleen Gerson speaks of the social dilemma of the exercise of
        these imposed gender roles in which women are responsible for taking
        care of the family and their home, while men are responsible for
        bringing money home and maintaining the family financially. She proposes
        “Facing these dilemmas, young women and men must develop innovative
        moral strategies to renegotiate work-family conflicts and transform
        traditional views of gender, but persisting institutional obstacles
        thwart their emerging aspirations to balance personal autonomy with
        caring for others. To overcome these obstacles, we need to create more
        humane, less gendered theoretical and social frameworks for
        understanding and apportioning moral obligation.” These social
        structures of what we expect from women can be related also to the media
        representation and its perpetuation of gender roles.{" "}
      </p>
      <h3> Globalization: </h3>
      <p>
        {" "}
        This is another concept that is related to feminism because to
        understand intersectional feminism we must also take into account
        capitalism, the economy, and the politics of the world. The concept of
        globalization refers to the interconnection of all the economies of the
        world, and it can be technological, political, cultural, or biological
        as well. We must take into account that the media also put women at the
        top of organizations and the military system as a gain for feminism when
        this is all contrary. Dean Spade and Sarah Lazare write about
        imperialism and the military-industrial complex: “The impacts of war —
        such as reduction in basic services, electricity, and access to food and
        water, loss of family members, and increased rates of illness and
        disability — all increase women’s vulnerability to assault and worsen
        the conditions of women’s labor” (“There’s Nothing Feminist About
        Imperialism”).{" "}
